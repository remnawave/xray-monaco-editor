# Xray Config Validator (xray-online)

Parse and validate xray's JSON configuration in your browser.

The basic idea is: Many GUI clients do not provide good error messages if a
JSON config fails to load. Users don't want to run the core directly to find
the error message. Therefore, let's use a browser tool in the style of
jsonlint.com.

Because some configuration validation happens after parsing, some mistakes are
not caught, only most typing mistakes. If you find an obvious gap that bothers
you, raise an issue.

## Contributing

xray-online uses a patched version of xray-core compiled to WASM. The build process is entirely driven through the `Makefile`. A POSIX shell is recommended, WSL is probably mandatory on Windows.

- `make build` to build the WASM module from scratch.
- `make dev-lite` to download the WASM module from GitHub instead.
- `make serve` to launch the development server.
